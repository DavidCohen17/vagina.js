vagina.js
===
Having problem organizing your variables? Don't want to pollute your global namespace? Try vagina.js! vagina.js is probably the game changer in Javascript.

Core codes

To let you understand how the magic works, I tried to keep it very simple such that you know how exactly it works even if you are a virgin in Javascript:
```js
var vagina = ({});
```

Usage
---
```js
/* set variable */
vagina.foo = 'bar';

/* get variable */
vagina.foo; //bar

/* special feature */
+vagina; //3.141592653589793
```
I personally found the PI method very useful because sometimes I just forgot about the syntax in Javascript to get the value of PI.
